vim-markmultiple
================

An emacs-like mark multiple plugin, inspired from this plugin:

[mark-multiple.el](https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el)

## Usage
**Ctrl-n** to activate and to go to the next match.
When you are tired, simply change the word under the cursor the usual way.

Screencast coming soon.

## Why highlighted words remain on screen?
Because you "Interrupted" the marking process without actually substituting
nothing. If this happens, simply call ```MarkMultipleClean()```


## Installation
Like any Pathogen bundle.

## Contributes
Yes, please. Pull requests welcome.
